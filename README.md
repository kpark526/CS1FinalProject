# CS1FinalProject

Solitaire final project by Kelley and Jude.

Freestyle Solitaire:
- Starts off with a shuffled deck of cards.
- All movements are up to the player, and can move cards anywhere.
- This allows for unlimited freedom, and a full game of solitaire can be played, but a vast majority of the actions are decided by the player.

"Classic" Solitaire:
- Starts off with a shuffled deck of cards and a premade board state.
- The gameplay area does have the classic solitaire layout (that is, *there are* cards underneath), but we were unable to implement proper cascading on the piles
- Basic solitaire rules implemented
- Restrictions
	- Cannot move piles at a time
	- Cannot view the stack created with revealed cards


To start a game, download all the files included. Then run the solitaire menu file. You can also run the file for the mode you want directly.
